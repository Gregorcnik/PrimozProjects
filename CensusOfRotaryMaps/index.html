    <hr>
    <p>
      During a workshop on Symmetries of discrete structures in Kranjska Gora in 2022, Marston Conder suggested that it would be worth extending his <a href="https://www.math.auckland.ac.nz/~conder/">census</a> of rotary maps of small genus (that went up to genus 301). To do that, an extension of the census of rotary maps on up to 1500/3000 edges in the non-orientable/orientable case (constructed by Pablo Spiga, Gabriel Verret and myself in 2014) would be useful. Using the same mathematical ideas, but improving and optimising some of the algorithms, we obtained a complete list of rotary maps (both chiral as well as reflexible) on up to 6000 edges in the orientable case, and up to 3000 edges in the non-orientable case. With some extra work (dealing with the maps of some particular valencies and face-lengths), we obtained all rotary maps on surfaces of genus up to 1501 (in the orientable case) and up to 1502 (in the non-orientable case). We have also computed the skeletons for all rotary maps having at most 2,000 edges.<br> 
          Some basic information about the maps are stored in the following excel files:<br>

            <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1501maps-chiral-data.xlsx">Chiral rotary maps of genus between 2 and 1,501.</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1501maps-orientable-refl-data.xlsx">Orientably reflexible maps of genus between 2 and 1,501.</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Genus1502maps-nonorientable-data.xlsx">Non-orientable rotary maps of genus between 2 and 1,502.</a></li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          The acual maps are given as a magma package, which is available for download in a zipped file 
          <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/RotaryMapsByGenus.zip">here</a>. 
          The functionalities of the magma package are described in this txt <a href="https://users.fmf.uni-lj.si/potocnik/RotaryMapsExtended/Readme.txt">file</a>
